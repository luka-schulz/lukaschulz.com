        <p>In <span class="italic">Design is Storytelling,</span> by Ellen Lupton, she talks about the <em>experience economy</em> as our current economic order. It is defined by a shift towards the ephemeral and the emotional over the cut-and-dry that is the service economy.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="italic mbl"><p>Cars become driving. Food becomes dining. Education becomes learning.<br><span style="color: #b4b4b4">&mdash;Ellen Lutpton</span></p></blockquote>
        
        <p>So what does a portfolio become when almost every designer has one? This got me thinking. How can I make my portfolio into an experience rather than just a display of my services, especially during in person interactions. I spent months mulling over ideas. I could load up on the JavaScript and make an emmersive web experience... but I wanted something more tangible. I thought about binding a book... but this felt overdone. Finally, it hit me. What if I used a View Master? This toy from my childhood brought back a flood of happy memories and once I thought about it I couldn't imagein doing anything else.</p>
        
        <p>After some research it turned out that I could create custom View Master reels online using <a href="#">Image3D</a>. Thus begun the conversion of my portfolio from a digital congolmerate of 1's and 0's to a physical token that can be touched and felt. To complete the experience I created a brochure to advertise the contents of my View Master.  When people see the toy they break out into laughter and smiles, and for me that is all I could ask for as a designer.
