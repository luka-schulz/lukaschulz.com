        <p>In the summer of 2018, I had the opportunity to take a week long class in machine learning (ML) with <a href="https://andreasrefsgaard.dk/">Andreas Refsgaard</a> and <a href="http://genekogan.com/">Gene Kogan</a>. If you are curious about the Copenhagen Institue of Interaction Design Summer School program, I have written about my experience <a href="#">here</a>. However, if you are curious about the project I made during that week... then this is the HTML file you were looking for.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mb">Learning Machine Learning</h2>
        
        <p>The goal of my project was to make a thing that could leverage machine learning. Albeit this is rather vague goal, it was my first time playing around with machine learning so it felt appropriate to set the bar low to give myself room to play. The idea for my project came from two rounds of brainstorming with two other friends. Of the 23 ideas that I had come up with, Goofy Google (Telephoney at the time) was the class favorite.</p>
        
        <p>The basic idea behind Goofy Google was to use the image-to-text model from <a href="#">Runway</a> to generate intersting Google search queries. By the end of the project though, it turned into something a little more hilarious. I ended up creating an autonmous agent that could traverse the strangness that is Google Images.</p>

        <blockquote class="pullout mbl">What would it look like if you let a Machine Learning algorithim explore  Google Images?</blockquote>
        
        <p>This project spawned from a brief brainstorming period that required us to come up with intersting applications for ML. Like most things, my idea seemed simple at face value. I wanted to use <a href="https://runwayml.com/">Runway</a>, a powerful client-side application for machine learning designed by <a href="https://cvalenzuelab.com/">Cris Valenzuela</a> to drive Google images. Earlier in the week we had seen how <a href="#">im2txt</a>, a pretrained model could be used to identify images.</p>
