## Portfolio of Luka Schulz
Hi hi, welcome to my `195.7mb` of the internet. Feel free to snoop and explore the inner workings of file structure. If you are so inclined as to use any of my code just let me know. If you have questions about my work, I can be reached via email at `hello[at]lukaschulz[.]com` or via a carrier pigeon sent to the James E. Booth Hall at the Rochester Institute of Technology, 1 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY.
