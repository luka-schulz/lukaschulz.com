## Portfolio of Luka Schulz
Hi hi, welcome to my `195.7mb` of the internet. Feel free to snoop around and explore the inner workings of my workings. If you are so inclined to use any or all of my code just let me know. If you have questions, I can be reached via email at `hello[at]lukaschulz[.]com` or via carrier pigeon sent to James E. Booth Hall at the Rochester Institute of Technology, 1 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY
