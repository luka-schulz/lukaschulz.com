        <p>I have been reading Peter Norvig and Stuart J. Russell's <a class="italic" href="https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a> and in the first chapter they mention that "For artificial intelligence to succeed, we need two things: intelligence and an artifact." Canonically, that artifact has always been the computer, however it got me thinking, could there be other artificats? Humans, being the judges of intelligence, by default are capable of housing intelligence. We are carbon based artifacts stemming from thousands of years of evolution.</p>
        
        <p>Computers, on the other hand are silicon based artifacts which for all intensive purposes have been in the making for a few hundred years. Though intelligence comparable to that of a human, let us call it working intelligence, is still years away, it is not unreasonable to imagine a near-future where working inteligence resides in a silicon based artifact. When this goal has been attained, then what? Of the many possibilites, Norvig and Russel's statment led me to think about the possibility that we might actively seek out new artificats for intelligence.</p>
        
        <p>If carbon and electricity can support intelligence, and silicon and electricity can also support intelligence, there might be a systematic way of determining artificats suitable for intelligence. If humans are able to do it once, they will want to automate it. However, it might not just be about determining artificats but also establishing frameworks for intelligence. The possibility of silicon based intelligence only exists because a few thousand years of mathematics were in place to allow for it, and just because 1's and 0's work for silicon, it does not mean that it will work for another artifact. Had it been that humans also operated on 1's and 0's I might think otherwise, but we don't. In fact, there is no overwhelming consensus about the framework that enables carbon intelligence.</p>
        
        <p>Knowing this leads to another curious thought, possibly, some artifacts are more intelligent than others. Or rather, they are able to sustain greater levels of complexity. Humans can understand intelligence as it pertains to silicon, but we are still stumped by carbon intellignce. It might be that the push for silicon is of necessity, it is the path of least resistance. We have latched on to what works and when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Maybe there are better artificats than either carbon or silicon? It will be intersting to see what we make of intelligence once / if we can control it. Currently, we only know have one source of working intelligence, but when intelligence becomes a comodity what comes of humans?</p>
