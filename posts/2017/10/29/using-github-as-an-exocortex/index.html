        <p>In science fiction, the <em>exocortex</em> has long been fabled as one of the next steps in human evolution. It is a device that would enable the external storage of personal memories, thus clearning the brain for new thoughts and ideas. This external hard drive could also be used to "reboot" you should you happen to die, for afterall, are you not just the sum of your memories?</p>
        
        <p>I have, by no means created a true exocortex, but I have found Github to be a powerful tool for storing the myriad links that I have come across in my journey through the internet. By publishing my repository to Github Pages, I can quickly share a huma-friendly form with my friends.</p>
        
        <p>I didn't realize how much anxiety I felt when it came to keeping track of my commonly visited links. The amount of effort it took to maintain all the links in working memory quickly more than I was willing to invest. Initally, I thought about creating a Wiki but this felt antique and not-open source</p>
